# jQuery & JSON Server Tutorial

## Overview
This project is a hands-on tutorial designed to teach you essential front-end development skills using jQuery and JSON Server. Throughout this project, you will learn how to load jQuery from a CDN, dynamically manipulate the DOM, handle events, perform AJAX operations, and implement pagination. Additionally, you'll simulate a REST API with JSON Server, making it an ideal environment for testing and prototyping dynamic web applications.

## Technologies Used
- **jQuery**: A powerful JavaScript library for DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX operations.
- **JSON Server**: A lightweight tool for creating a full fake REST API with minimal setup.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core web technologies for building and styling your project.
- **Editors**: Recommended tools include vi, vim, emacs, or Visual Studio Code.

## Learning Objectives
- **Loading jQuery from a CDN:** Learn how to quickly include jQuery in your projects using a Content Delivery Network.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Discover different methods for creating, modifying, and adding DOM elements using jQuery.
- **Event Handling:** Implement click events and use event delegation to handle dynamic elements.
- **AJAX Operations:** Master the basics of GET, POST, DELETE, and other AJAX requests with jQuery.
- **Pagination:** Build a basic pagination system to manage and display large sets of data.
- **REST API Simulation:** Utilize JSON Server to simulate backend interactions and test your AJAX calls.
