# Project: HTML5 Forms - A Guide to Usability and Accessibility

## Description

This project is a practical exercise in building modern, user-friendly, and accessible web forms using only HTML and CSS. The goal is to move beyond basic form creation and embrace best practices that ensure every user can interact with our forms efficiently and without frustration. The styles and structure are designed to work on modern browsers like Chrome 78 and newer, without the use of any external libraries or frameworks.

## Learning Objectives

After reviewing the code and concepts in this project, you should be able to explain and demonstrate the following:

-   **How to create a semantic HTML5 form:** Understanding the roles of `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, and `<legend>`.
-   **How to choose the right input type:** Leveraging HTML5 input types (`email`, `date`, `number`, etc.) for better user experience and validation.
-   **How to constrain form fields:** Using attributes like `required`, `pattern` with regular expressions, `minlength`, and `maxlength`.
-   **How to style form states:** Applying CSS to `:valid`, `:invalid`, `:required`, and other pseudo-classes for real-time user feedback.
-   **How to build common forms:** Implementing practical examples like a user comment form and a search form.
-   **How to create usable and accessible forms:** The principles of linking labels, providing clear instructions, and ensuring keyboard navigation is logical.

## Core Concepts & Best Practices

### 1. The Foundation of Accessible Forms: `<label>`

The single most important practice is to **always** use a `<label>` for every form input and connect it explicitly. This provides a larger clickable area for mobile users and is essential for screen reader users to understand the purpose of the input.

```html
<label for="user_email">Email Address:</label>
<input type="email" id="user_email" name="email_address">

Email Address: <input type="email">
<label>Email Address:</label> <input type="email">
