# Cookies: A Quick Learning Recap

## Overview
This document is a brief summary of the core concepts and best practices I learned about cookies in web development.

## What are Cookies?
- **Definition:** Small text files stored in the userâ€™s browser.
- **Purpose:** They help manage sessions, store preferences, and track user interactions, enabling stateful experiences in otherwise stateless HTTP communications.

## Key Attributes
- **Name & Value:** The fundamental components holding user data.
- **Expiration:** Defines the lifetime of a cookie.
- **Scope:** Determined by the domain and path attributes.
- **Security Flags:** Including:
  - **HttpOnly:** Restricts access via client-side scripts.
  - **Secure:** Ensures cookies are sent only over HTTPS.
  - **SameSite:** Helps mitigate cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

## How Cookies Work
- **Creation:** Set through HTTP headers (e.g., `Set-Cookie`) or via JavaScript.
- **Transmission:** Automatically sent with each subsequent HTTP request to the server.
- **Management:** They can be updated, deleted, or set to expire based on defined conditions.

## Security and Best Practices
- **Minimize Data Storage:** Keep only essential data in cookies.
- **Apply Proper Flags:** Use `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` to enhance cookie security.
- **Regular Maintenance:** Regularly clear or update cookies to reduce security risks.

## Conclusion
Understanding cookies is crucial for developing secure and user-friendly web applications. They not only manage user sessions and personalization but also require diligent security practices to protect user data.
