## Overview

Website accessibility focuses on removing barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites by people with disabilities. Following accessibility guidelines and implementing best practices can improve usability for all visitors, while also meeting legal and regulatory requirements in many regions.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Inclusivity**: Over a billion people worldwide have some form of disability. Accessible design ensures everyone can engage with your content.
- **Legal Requirements**: Many countries have laws mandating digital accessibility (e.g., the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the U.S., the European Accessibility Act in the EU).
- **Better User Experience**: Accessibility improvements (e.g., clear navigation, readable text, proper color contrast) benefit all users, not just those with disabilities.
- **SEO Advantages**: Search engines reward sites that have well-structured, semantic markup and properly labeled media.

## Accessibility Standards

The most widely recognized guidelines for web accessibility are:

- **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**: 
  - Produced by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).
  - Current recommended version is **WCAG 2.1** (with 2.2 in draft as of this writing).
- **Section 508 (U.S.)**: Standards for federal agencies, often referenced as a benchmark for public-facing websites.
- **EN 301 549 (EU)**: Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services.

## Getting Started

1. **Plan for Accessibility Early**  
   Incorporate accessibility requirements at the beginning of your design and development process. Retroactive fixes can be more complex and time-consuming.
   
2. **Use Semantic HTML**  
   Ensure that you’re using correct and descriptive HTML tags (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, etc.) for clear, meaningful structure.
   
3. **Provide Text Equivalents**  
   Include descriptive `alt` attributes for images, captions for videos, and transcripts for audio to support screen readers.

4. **Check Keyboard Navigation**  
   Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard alone. This includes links, buttons, and form fields.

5. **Ensure Color Contrast**  
   Verify sufficient contrast between foreground (text) and background to assist users with low vision or color blindness.

## Best Practices

### 1. Headings and Structure
- Use headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) in hierarchical order to organize content logically.
- Clearly label sections so users with screen readers can navigate easily.

### 2. Forms and Labels
- Provide clear, descriptive labels for all form fields.
- Use `aria-describedby` or `aria-labelledby` where necessary to add additional context (e.g., inline help text or error messages).

### 3. Media (Images, Video, Audio)
- **Images**: Use `alt` text to describe the purpose of the image. If the image is decorative, leave the `alt` attribute empty (`alt=""`) to ensure screen readers skip it.
- **Video/Audio**: Provide captions or transcripts for multimedia content.

### 4. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
- Use ARIA attributes (`role`, `aria-label`, `aria-live`, etc.) judiciously to enhance semantic meaning—but do not rely on ARIA if native HTML elements or attributes can serve the same purpose.

### 5. Focus and Visibility
- Ensure that focusable elements have a clear visual focus state (e.g., an outline or highlight when selected).
- Avoid unexpected focus changes that can disorient users relying on a keyboard or screen reader.

### 6. Responsive and Zoom-Friendly
- Use responsive design techniques to support various device sizes.
- Ensure users can zoom up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

### 7. Clear and Consistent Navigation
- Provide consistent navigation (e.g., menus, breadcrumbs) across pages.
- Use clear calls-to-action and descriptive link text (avoid “click here” or “read more”
