Web Accessibility Project

This project focuses on the fundamental principles of web accessibility. The goal is to build web pages that are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, by applying established standards and best practices.
The Importance of Web Accessibility

Web accessibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed.

    Ethical Imperative: It provides equal access and opportunity to people with diverse abilities. It's simply the right thing to do.
    Broader Audience: An accessible site can reach more users, including the millions of people with disabilities.
    Improved User Experience & SEO: Many accessibility practices, like proper header structure and alt text, improve overall usability and search engine optimization.
    Legal Compliance: Accessibility is required by law in many countries and for many organizations (e.g., Section 508 in the US).

WCAG Conformance Levels

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the international standard for accessibility. They are organized into three levels of conformance:

    Level A (Minimum): The most basic level. If these criteria are not met, a site is likely impossible for some users to access. This is the essential baseline.
    Level AA (Mid-range): The target level for most websites and the standard often cited in legal requirements. It addresses the most common and significant barriers. This should be the goal for most projects.
    Level AAA (Highest): The most stringent level, making content accessible to the widest possible audience. It is not always possible to meet this level for all content.

The Purpose of ARIA

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements. Its main purpose is to add context and semantics to dynamic web content and custom components that standard HTML cannot convey.

For example, ARIA can tell a screen reader what a custom element's role is (e.g., role="slider"), what its current state is (e.g., aria-expanded="true"), or provide it with an accessible name (aria-label).

The First Rule of ARIA: If a native HTML element (like <button>, <nav>, or <input>) can be used, use it first.
Key Accessibility Tools

To ensure a site is accessible, a combination of automated and manual testing is required.

    Automated Tools: Browser extensions and built-in tools like Chrome Lighthouse, axe DevTools, and WAVE can quickly scan for code-level issues like color contrast errors or missing alt text.
    Manual Testing: This is critical for assessing true usability.
        Keyboard-Only Navigation: Using the Tab key to navigate and the Enter key to activate elements.
        Screen Reader Testing: Using software like VoiceOver (macOS), NVDA (Windows), or JAWS (Windows) to experience the site as a visually impaired user would.
